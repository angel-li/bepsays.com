**The Akai EWI wind controller is a frequent sell on eBay, as people don't realize it is not a toy -- it is a real music instrument.**

<!--more-->

And as with all real instruments, you have to invest some practice until it gets fun.

I have had my EWI USB for a month or so now. Read on to see how it stacks up with the Yamaha WX11 I had back in the 90s.

## My Setup



### Hardware and Software

* iPad Air 2 16GB WIFI
* [Magellan](http://www.yonac.com/magellan/) synth with [mkirino01's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKvo1yZBkr0) great, free patches (as shown in the picture above).
* [Thor synth with Patchman patches](http://www.patchmanmusic.com/PropellerheadThor.html)

The free Magellan synth combined with the free patches is the best 15 USD I ever spent. The patches may be a little limited in choice, but they sound smashing.


**For wireless/bluetooth connection:**

* [UD-BT01 bluetooth dongle](http://usa.yamaha.com/products/music-production/accessories/usb-midi/ud-bt01/)
* An USB battery/powerbank, use [this](http://www.clasohlson.com/no/Clas-Ohlson,-Powerbank-2600-mAh-/Pr386941000)
* A way to set the IOS bluetooth midi device. I use  see [Yamaha support](http://faq.yamaha.com/us/en/article/music-production/accessories/usb-midi/ud-bt01/11021/9065). I use the [Visual performer app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/visual-performer-us/id548859733?mt=8).
* UD-BT01 utility to set bluetooth device name and update firmware: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/md-bt01-ud-bt01-utility-us/id1106859013?mt=8
* 
**For wired connection:**

* Logik 4 ports USB HUB
* * [Apple Lightning to USB Camera Adapter](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD821AM/A/lightning-to-usb-camera-adapter)

 You need an USB HUB to get rid of the error message on the iPad saying _"attached accessory uses too much power."_ Any USB HUB should work fine, powered or not.

### Settings

## Akai EWI vs Yamaha WX
The wind controller is an old invention -- from back in the 80s when it was science fiction. Very little has happened with the technology since back then.

The market is still dominated by two products, the [Akai EWI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWI_(musical_instrument)) and the [Yamaha WX](http://usa.yamaha.com/products/music-production/midi-controllers/wx5/) (from oldest to the current model: WX7, WX11 and WX5).

I had a WX11 back in the 90s, played in combination with the [Yamaha VL-70m and the Patchman patches](http://www.patchmanmusic.com/yamahaVL70m.html).

After some weeks with the EWI USB I can say this about the core differences:

*  Yamaha's mouthpiece controller, with a reed controlling pitch bend, is superior, making it easy to get a natural sounding vibrato that is harder to get out of the EWI.
*  EWI's keys, and especially the octave mechanism, are way better. The Yamaha may be easier to get started with, but forget about doing the super-fast runs as heard by Michael Brecker in his rendition of [In a Sentimental Mood](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjj1ZWGwq3PAhUCCSwKHW1NDSIQtwIIJDAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqNhDWbhmQk4&usg=AFQjCNFJtdvVEJ71snAyTYRlcbR_DcWybw&sig2=TGhvR0PeigQTpAXyEBSCUQ). **An important note: The EWI USB has only four octaves, compared to the eight of the EWI 4000 and EWI 5000, and the uppermost and lowest octave can be a little clumsy to get to when going fast.**

Roland recently released the [Aerophone AE 10](https://www.roland.com/global/products/aerophone_ae-10/). I haven't tried it, but there are some impressive demos online. It seems to have a mouthpiece similar to the Yamaha, but have opted for keys similar to the saxophone, which I think is a mistake on a digital instrument.

## Improvements to my setup

The big plus about the EWI USB is that it is so easy to just grab and start playing, either solo or with some accompagnement from the iPad or iPhone, so compact that you can even bring it with you on trips.

I really wish Akai would release a new version of the EWI USB with:

* Built-in battery and Bluetooth midi support.
* A full set of octave rollers, similar to EWI 4000/5000.

The EWI 5000 comes with battery wireless SOUND transmission, but that is a design mistake, I think.

I'm having so much fun with this thing, that I will probably eventually replace my Android phone with an iPhone, and pair it with some nice bluetooth headphones, to get an even more compact setup ...
