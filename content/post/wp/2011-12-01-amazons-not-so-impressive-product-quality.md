**All physical items I have bought from Amazon has failed on me.  Since June: Three dead Kindles and one leather cover with a dead integrated light.**

I wrote a glorifying article about [Amazon's impressive customer service ](http://bepsays.com/2011/08/amazons-impressing-customer-service/)a while ago, and the service is still impressive. I know, because I have used it a lot.

  * I received a replacement for my defect Kindle DX.

	
  * But as I had a new and smaller Kindle 3, I left the DX untouched in the box.

	
  * The LED light on the Kindle 3-cover shone for a couple of minutes, then it died.

	
  * Last week my Kindle 3 froze. All online guides about how to reset and reboot the device failed.

	
  * So I charged my new Kindle DX, started it. Only some flicker in the upper left corner, otherwise dead.


So now I have to return two more Kindles (of total three) and one cover for replacements.

Amazon still deliver on service, but I question their product quality.
