**The Victorinox Swiss Army Alliance fits nicely into my mighty (:-)) watch collection: A [Bulova Precisionist Claremont]( http://bepsays.com/2012/02/what-a-nice-watch/), a vintage [Longines gold dress watch](http://www.collectorsweekly.com/stories/6165-longines-gold-watch?in=783-unsolved-mysteries) and a [Timex DataLink 150](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Datalink) (vintage too, I guess. And certified by NASA for space travel).**

Many things to like about this watch:

  * Size is just right	
  * It looks smashing; classic look that goes well with both jeans and a suit
  * The strap is very nice
  * It has got a sapphire crystal

Yes, it comes with a Swiss quartz movement, not automatic or manual. And it is not an [IWC ](http://www.icw.com)– but it shares some of that brand's simple and classic lines, and at around 300 USD it is practically free in comparison.

The only thing I do not like about it is the quality of the luminous display. Do not expect to keep track of time when in bed at night.
