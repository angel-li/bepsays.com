**The Akai EWI wind controller is a frequent sell on eBay, as people don't realize it is not a toy -- it is a real instrument.**

<!--more-->

And as with all real instruments, you have to invest some practice until it gets fun.

I have had my EWI USB for three weeks now. Read on to see how it stacks up with the Yamaha WX11 I had back in the 90s.

## My Setup

{{< img src="/assets/img/2016/ewi/akai-ewi-ipad-setup.jpg" caption="My EWI with iPad setup." >}}

### Hardware and Software

* iPad Air 2 16GB WIFI
* Logik 4 ports USB HUB
* [Apple Lightning to USB Camera Adapter](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD821AM/A/lightning-to-usb-camera-adapter)
* [Magellan](http://www.yonac.com/magellan/) synth with [mkirino01's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKvo1yZBkr0) great, free patches (as shown in the picture above).
* [Thor synth with Patchman patches](http://www.patchmanmusic.com/PropellerheadThor.html)

A couple of notes on the above:

* You need an USB HUB to get rid of the error message on the iPad saying "attached accessory uses too much power." Any USB HUB should work fine, powered or not.
* The free Magellan synth combined with the free patches is the best 15 USD I ever spent. The patches may be a little limited in choice, but they sound smashing.

## Akai EWI vs Yamaha WX
The wind controller is an old invention -- from back in the 80s when it was science fiction. Very little has happened with the technology since back then.

The market is still dominated by two products, the [Akai EWI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWI_(musical_instrument)) and the [Yamaha WX](http://usa.yamaha.com/products/music-production/midi-controllers/wx5/) (from oldest to the current model: WX7, WX11 and WX5).

I had a WX11 back in the 90s, played in combination with the [Yamaha VL-70m and the Patchman patches](http://www.patchmanmusic.com/yamahaVL70m.html).

After some weeks with the EWI USB I can say this about the core differences:

*  Yamaha's mouthpiece controller, with a reed controlling pitch bend, is superior, making it easy to get a natural sounding vibrato not really possible to get out of the EWI.
*  EWI's keys, and especially the octave mechanism, are way better. The Yamaha may be easier to get started with, but forget about doing the super-fast runs as heard by Michael Brecker in his rendition of [In a Sentimental Mood](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjj1ZWGwq3PAhUCCSwKHW1NDSIQtwIIJDAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqNhDWbhmQk4&usg=AFQjCNFJtdvVEJ71snAyTYRlcbR_DcWybw&sig2=TGhvR0PeigQTpAXyEBSCUQ). **An important note: The EWI USB has only four octaves, compared to the eight of the EWI 4000 and EWI 5000, and the uppermost and lowest octave can be a little clumsy to get to when going fast.**
