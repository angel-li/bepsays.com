**Buying Nike sneakers online is almost impossible if you're not into Nike's weird metrics where a centimetre isn't a centimetre.** 
<!--more-->

So, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre), a centimetre is	0.01 metres
or 0.393700787401574803149606299212598425196850 inches.

According to Nike, it all depends on where you live and who you ask. Confusing? Oh yea!

**How do Nike make money on online sales? Beats me.**

My story starts with my aunt from Bergen. She is very generous and gave me some money for Christmas, wanting me to buy something concrete. 

This story ends with a purchase from a friendly and helpful woman in a Eurosko shop. A real shop. In a building. With real shoes. That I could test-drive. The woman looked very similar to the wife of a relative of mine, but that's another story.

Me being a one-pair-shoe guy, thinking, one more pair wouldn't hurt. My trusted Rockport Oxcford blacks could do with a companion. I remember my older brother asking me, when on a hike in the mountains of Jotunheimen: "Are you really wearing those dress shoes up here in the mud?"

Well, they are comfy. But I did need something else. But going online for Nikes was doomed impossible:

## The bay of confusion
As soon as you type in "Nike" in the search engines of the ebay, you get confusing results of "Nike shoes is always a little small" and "the Nikes fits as advertised".

The two sizin charts below is what Nike presents to the EU (first screen shot) and the US market.

{{< img src="/assets/img/2015/nike/nike-en-eu.png" caption="Nike EU size chart">}}

I do not live in neither, but Norway has agreed to the EÃ˜S agreement, so lets stick with EU, for this argument's sake.

So, the leason learned for me is that I now know a lot about shoe sizes and a lot about my own shoe size. But I know nothing about how that knowledge compares to Nike's reality. So that brand will have to be off-line.

So Nike, if you read this and want to respond: Please send me an email to bjorn.erik.pedersen at gmail.com. I'm intrigued by this puzzling stupidity.
