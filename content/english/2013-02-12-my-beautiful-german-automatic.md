**The gallery below says it all: It is a German Kemmner Tonneau automatic watch with a Swiss [ETA 2824-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA_SA#ETA_2824-2) movement.**

Fantastic watch. Just google [Erkahund](https://www.google.com/search?q=erkahund) and you will find it. I love it, and have been using it as a everyday watch â€“ but I guess it is really a dress watch. A special one.
