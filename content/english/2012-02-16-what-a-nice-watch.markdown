**I got myself a new watch, the Bulova Precisionist Claremont. At about 170 USD from Amazon.com its a bargain. The continuously sweeping second hand is impressive, and it looks fantastic. Some say it is big, but the curved design makes it just right.**

The only detail I'm not entirely sure about is the faux croc strap. I might do as [this guy](http://forums.watchuseek.com/f9/bulova-precisionist-claremont-96b127-pictorial-471507.html): Get a replacement.

This item adds nicely to my mighty watch collection: A vintage [Longines gold dress watch](http://www.collectorsweekly.com/stories/6165-longines-gold-watch?in=783-unsolved-mysteries) and a [Timex DataLink 150](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Datalink) (vintage too, I guess. And certified by NASA for space travel).
