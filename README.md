This is the source of [bepsays.com](http://bepsays.com/).

If you're looking for an open source license, there isn't one. This is open, but closed, like that principle introduced by Bertrand Meyer. It's not that I'm not in the sharing mode, but I'm not very keen on people pushing out clones of my personal blog.

Please, get inspired; pick ideas and snippets, but do not copy-and-paste the whole thing.

## Credits

* It's built with [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo), Jekyll's faster cousin. **NOTE: This will build fine against the latest Hugo (0.13-DEV). There is a patch that enables angled quotes that isn't (yet) in there, but those will just be ignored...**
* It's built upon [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a Jekyll-theme (!) created by one of the Bootstrap-founders, Mark Otto.
* The sharing bar is built with *[Socialite](https://github.com/tmort/Socialite)*.
* The galleries are built with [nanoGALLERY](http://nanogallery.brisbois.fr/).
* Fonts are currently _FF Meta Serif_ and _FF Meta Sans Condensed_.

And lots of other stuff.

If you notice a language you don't understand, it's Norwegian Nynorsk.
