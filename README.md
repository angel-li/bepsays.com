This is the source of [bepsays.com](http://bepsays.com/).

If you're looking for an open source license, there isn't one. This is open, but closed, like that principle introduced by Bertrand Meyer. It's not that I'm not in the sharing mode, but I'm not very keen on people pushing out clones of my personal blog.

Please, be inspired -- pick ideas and snippets, but do not copy-and-paste the whole thing.

# Credits

* It's built with [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo), Jekyll's faster cousin. **NOTE: This site will not build with the current version of Hugo, release or master. I have submitted some patches that will bot improve that already great piece of software and make this site buildable out-of-the-box.**
* It's built upon [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a Jekyll-theme (!) created by one of the Bootstrap-founders, Mark Otto.
* The sharing bar is *[Socialite](https://github.com/tmort/Socialite)*.
* The galleries is [nanoGALLERY](http://nanogallery.brisbois.fr/).
* Fonts are currently _FF Meta Serif_ and _FF Meta Sans Condensed_.

And lots of other stuff.

If you notice a language you don't understand, it's Norwegian Nynorsk.
